              While your customers save money with blip, you save too.
              <br><br>
              Our goal is to make blip accessible to renters of all income. Utility companies lose millions every year powering extra peaker plants in order to meet demand. These are plants that run specifically to meet the demand during peak hours.
              <br><br>
              With enough blips shifting the time that energy is needed, utility companies won’t need to run peaker plants.
              <br><br>
              Utility companies save money. Your customers save money. It’s a win-win for everyone.

              Utility companies can expand their market of energy saving consumers. As utility companies move into Time of Use pricing, more people can benefit from saving energy - even if they don’t have solar panels.
